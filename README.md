A data science project investigating coffee product pricing using web scraping, clustering, SQL, and ML — presented through an interactive dashboard.

# ☕ Jumbo Coffee Pricing Analysis

An end-to-end data science project exploring and visualizing coffee prices from Dutch supermarket "JUMBO". This project combines real-world data scraping, advanced data processing, exploratory analysis, SQL, machine learning, and a fully interactive dashboard to deliver actionable insights in a real consumer market.

## 🔍 Data Overview

- **Source**: Scraped from real Dutch supermarket websites (e.g., Jumbo)
- **Variables**: `name`, `brand`, `type`, `price`, `quantity`, `unit_price`
- **Unit Price Standardized**: Per gram or capsule for fair comparison

---

## 📈 Sample Insights

- **Illy** dominates high-end coffee pricing  
- **Melitta** and **Perla** offer budget options  
- **Capsules** are significantly more expensive per gram than beans  
- Clustering reveals 3 distinct product-price segments  

---

## 🧠 ML Summary

- **Model**: Linear Regression  
- **Features**: Quantity, Type  
- **Target**: Unit Price  
- **Performance**:  
  - R² Score: 0.34  
  - MSE: 0.00017  
- **Interpretation**: Explains pricing partially — other hidden factors likely affect prices

## 🧾 SQL Analysis

This project also includes SQL-based analysis using SQLite to explore product pricing patterns and perform custom queries. This highlights familiarity with databases and structured querying in a data science workflow.
